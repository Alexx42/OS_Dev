	------- CONSTRUCTOR -------


Follow the System V ABI used by gcc

When gcc is going to compile, it's gonna use 5 different object files that together handle the program initialization.
- crt0.o
- crti.o
- crtbegin.o
- crtend.o
- crtn.o
These object files implement two sepcial functions:
- _init : runs global constructor and other initialization tasks
- _fini : runs global destructors and other terminations tasks. 

crtbegin.o and crtend.o contain the internals that the compiler wishes to hide from us but wants us to use.
crt0.o contains the program entry point (_start) and calls the special _init function that runs the program initialization tasks.

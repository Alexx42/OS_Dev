	----- POST -----

When a computer is switched on or reset, it runs through a series of diagnostics called POST - Power-On-Self-Test.
This sequence culminates in locating a bootable device, such as Floppy disk, CD-ROM or a Hard disk in the order that the firmware is configured to.

	----- Master Boot Record -----

The BIOS checks bootable devices for a boot signature, a so called magic number. The boot signature is in a boot sector (sector number 0)  and it contains the byte sequence 0x55, 0xAA at byte offsets 510 and 511.
When the BIOS finds such a boot setor, it is loaded into memory at : 0x0000:0x7c00 (segment 0, address 0x7c00).
Execution is then transferred to the freshly loaded boot record. On a floppy disk, all 512 bytes of the boot record may contain executable code.
On a hard drive, the Master Boot Record (MBR) holds executable code at offset 0x0000-0x01bd, followed by table entries for the four primary partitions, using sixteen bytes per entry (0x01be-0x01fd), and the two-byte signature (0x01fe - 0x01ff).


	----- Early Environment ------

The DL register holds the drive code from where your boot code was loader.
The CPU is currently in Real Mode.

	----- Kernel ------


Finally, the bootloader loads the kernel into memory and passes control to it.

Linux is the best known open source OS

It receives requets from programs and relay those requests to the computer's hardware

Core components of a Linux system

	    -------- CORE COMPONENTS ---------

- Boot loader
This is the part of the system that is executed first. It loads the kernel. If you have multiple OS, then it asks you which one you want to start. The most populars bootloaders are GRUB and Lilo.
The boot loader creates the boot sequence that the Linux kernel requires, loading spme device drivers required for early boot process into memory, and starting the kernel.

- Kernel
It is the central component of the system that communicates directly with the hardware.
The kernel allocates system resources like memory, processor time, hard disk space and external devices to the prograns running on the computer. It separates each program from the others, so that when one of them encounters an error, others are not affected. 

- Daemons
Services running as processes in the background, taking care of things like configuring your network connection, responding to connected USB devices, managing user logins, mnaging filesystems. They are called 'daemons'.
One of the daemons, started by the kernel after it started itself, is called init. It's role is to start the rest of the system, including all other daemons and graphical sessions.

- Shell
The shell, implements a textual interface that allow you to run programs and control the system by entering commands from the keyboard. It is only a program.

- X Window Server
Graphical replacement for the command shell. Responsible for drawing graphics and processing input from keyboards, mouse, tablets and other devices.
X server is network transparent, that is, it allows you to work in a graphical environment both on your own computer and on a remote computer.

- Window Manager
Program that communicates with the X server. Its taks is managing windows. 

- Desktop environment
User interface for most common tasks. Only one part of the OS and not all of it. 




		------ FILE SYSTEM --------


The hard drive accepts commands like :
"read blocks no .550923 and put it in memory address 0x1212312"

A file is an area of the disk which stores data and which has a name (like "example.txt"). Files are organized in cllections called directories. Directories can contain other directories, in a tree-like structure. Each file can be identified by a unic path, which describrs its place in the directory hierarchy.
In Linux, the top level directory is called the root directory. Everything must be a descendant of the root directory. The root directory usually contains only a small number of subdirectories, the most important are : 
- bin : programs needed to perfom basic tasks
- dev : special files that represent hardware devices
- etc : configuration files
- home : contains private directories of users
- media : for external drives connected to the compute
- tmp : temporary files
- user : programs installed on the computer
- var : variable data produced by programs. 


Devices, as files, may send and receive data. Because of this, Linus represents the devices connected to the system as files in the /dev directory. It simplifies application programming.


Mount :  Place access to the file system contained within onto your root file system structure. 
Example: Mounting /dev/sdb1 to /mnt/disk1 places all the files and folders contained within the device sdb1 into the directory /mnt/disk1 where you can access them

When we insert a USB key, or a CD drive, it is automatically mounted in a subdirectory of /media. 

		-------- USERS --------


Metaphor for something interacting with the system. Users are identified by a username and a password. Internally, each user has a unique number assigned, which is called a user ID, or UID for short. 
Users can be assigned in groups.
There is one special user in all Linux sysyems, which has the user name "root" and UID 0. It is also called superuser. He can do anything, and is not controlled in any way by the security mechanisms. 
You can acccess files of another user with shell commands, you need to have the username and the password.

	     ------- FILE PERMISSIONS --------

Each file has an owner, one of the users, it can also be assigned to a group, but the owner must be a member of the group.
Each file has 3 kinds of permissions: read, write and execute. These permissions can be assigned to three kinds of owner realtions: owner, group, and other. Other includes all users who are not the owner of the file and do not belong to the group which owns the file.
Only the file owner or the superuser can change the permissions or ownership of a file.

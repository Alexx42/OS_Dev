The standard Linux executable format is name ELF for Executable Linking Format.

The ELF standard specifies multiple file formats:
object files : .o (they make the compilation faster)
executable files
archive files : .a
shared object files : .o


Compiler toolchains generate and read ELF files

Operating systems read and run ELF files

It contains:
- ELF header pointing to the position of the SHT and PHT
- SHT, each has e_shnum section headers, pointing to a section
- PHT, each has e_phnum program headers, pointing to a segment

Loading process:
1 - The elf header is parsed and the program header is parsed
2 - The file is mapped in memory according to its segments
3 - entry is called, syscalls are accessed

Section exists before linking, in object files, one or mpre sections will be put inside one segment by the linker
Is this section
- raw data to be loaded into memory, .data .text etc
- metadata, that will be used but disappear at runtime, .symtab, .srttab, .rela.text

Segments exists after linking, in the executable file
Contain information about how each section should be loaded into memory by the OS, notably location and permissions

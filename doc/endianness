Little endian and big endian are two ways of storing multibyte data-types

In little endian machines, last byte of binary representation of the data-type is stored first
In big endian, it's the opposit

Example:

An integer with the value: 0x123456, will be stored:
- In little endian : 65 43 21
- In big endian    : 12 34 56
